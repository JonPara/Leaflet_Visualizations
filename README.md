## Background

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

1. **The data set**

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Earthquakes from the past seven days were used in order to present the visualizations. A JSON file was given by the USGS to extract the data and have the ability to visualize a world map of earthquakes using Leaflet

2. **Import & Visualized Data**

   A map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Also includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * A legend was added to understand the magnitude based off of colors given.
   
2. **Tectonic Plates**

  The USGS also gives us a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
